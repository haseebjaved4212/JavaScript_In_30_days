# Day 11: JavaScript Local Storage & Session Storage (Project: Note-Taking App)


Welcome to Day 11 of my 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge! Today, we're diving into client-side data storage mechanisms: Local Storage and Session Storage. These Web Storage APIs allow web applications to store data locally within the user's browser, providing a way to persist information across browser sessions or tabs without needing a server-side database.

For our project, we'll build a Simple Note-Taking App with Local Storage. This application will demonstrate how to save, load, and manage notes directly in the user's browser.

## ðŸ“š Core Concepts Covered:

**1. Introduction to Web Storage (Local Storage & Session Storage)**

The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser. This is an improvement over cookies, offering significantly more storage capacity (typically 5MB-10MB per domain) and not being sent with every HTTP request.

- **Key-Value Pairs:** Both Local Storage and Session Storage store data as strings in key-value pairs.

- **Domain-Specific:** Data is stored per origin (domain, protocol, and port). A website can only access its own stored data.

**2. Local Storage (localStorage)**

localStorage stores data with no expiration date. The data will persist even when the browser window is closed and reopened. It's ideal for long-term data persistence.

- **Persistence:** Data remains until explicitly deleted by the user, by JavaScript, or by browser settings.

- **Scope:** Data is accessible across all windows/tabs from the same origin.

**Common localStorage Methods:**

- `localStorage.setItem(key, value):` Stores a key-value pair.

- **Both key and value must be strings.** If you try to store an object or array directly, it will be converted to [object Object] or a comma-separated string.

- **Important:** To store objects or arrays, you must first convert them to a JSON string using JSON.stringify().

**Example (String):**

 ``localStorage.setItem('username', 'Alice');``

**Example (Object/Array):**

`` localStorage.setItem('userProfile', JSON.stringify({ name: 'Bob', age: 30 }));``

- `localStorage.getItem(key):` Retrieves the value associated with a given key.

Returns the value as a string, or null if the key does not exist.

- **Important:** If you stored an object/array as a JSON string, you must parse it back into a JavaScript object/array using JSON.parse().

- **Example (String):** 
`const username = localStorage.getItem('username'); // 'Alice'`

- **Example (Object/Array):**

` const userProfile = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('userProfile')); // { name: 'Bob', age: 30 }`

-` localStorage.removeItem(key):`

 Removes the key-value pair with the specified key.

- **Example:** 

`localStorage.removeItem('username');`

- `localStorage.clear():` Removes all key-value pairs from localStorage for the current origin.

**Example:** 

`localStorage.clear();`

- `localStorage.length:` Returns the number of key-value pairs currently stored.

**Example:**

`console.log(localStorage.length);`

**3. Session Storage (sessionStorage)**

`sessionStorage` stores data for the duration of a single browser session. The data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed. It's ideal for temporary data that needs to persist across page reloads within the same session.

**Persistence:** Data is cleared when the session ends (tab/window is closed).

**Scope:** Data is accessible only within the specific tab/window that created it. If you open a new tab to the same page, it will have its own separate sessionStorage.

**Common sessionStorage Methods:**

sessionStorage uses the exact same methods as localStorage: `sessionStorage.setItem()`, 

`sessionStorage.getItem()`,

 `sessionStorage.removeItem()`, 
 
 `sessionStorage.clear()`,
 
  and 
 `sessionStorage.length`.

**Example:**

`sessionStorage.setItem('currentOrderId', 'XYZ123');`

**4. Differences and Use Cases:**

 **Feature**

- localStorage

- sessionStorage

- Persistence

- Data persists even after browser is closed.

- Data cleared when the browser tab/window is closed.

- Scope

- Accessible across all tabs/windows of same origin.

- Accessible only within the tab/window that created it.

- Capacity

- 5MB - 10MB per origin.

- 5MB - 10MB per origin.

**Use Cases**

- User preferences, "Remember Me" functionality, offline data, cached assets.

- Shopping cart data for current session, temporary user input, single-session state.

**5. Error Handling with Web Storage**

While generally robust, localStorage and sessionStorage can throw errors in certain rare scenarios, such as:

- **Storage Limit Exceeded:** If you try to store more data than the browser allows.

- **Security/Privacy Settings:** If the user's browser settings block local storage.

- **SecurityError:** Can occur in certain sandboxed environments (e.g., iframes from different origins).

It's good practice to wrap setItem and getItem calls in try...catch blocks, especially when dealing with potentially large data or in complex environments.
```js
try {
    localStorage.setItem('largeData', JSON.stringify(someLargeObject));
} catch (e) {
    if (e.name === 'QuotaExceededError') {
        console.error("Local storage limit exceeded!");
        // Inform user or clear some old data
    } else {
        console.error("Error accessing local storage:", e);
    }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Project for Day 11: Simple Note-Taking App with Local Storage

Today's project is a functional Note-Taking Application that leverages localStorage to persist your notes. You will be able to add new notes, view existing notes, and delete notes, with all changes automatically saved to and loaded from your browser's local storage.

**Features:**

- Add new notes with a title and content.

- Display a list of all saved notes.

- Delete individual notes.

- All notes persist across browser sessions (even after closing and reopening the browser).

- Clear all notes functionality.
